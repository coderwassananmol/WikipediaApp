## About WikipediaApp

It is a web-based App made using PHP MVC Framework "Laravel". The parser parses the main page of the language you select and returns the following information:

- Featured article
- Total number of articles
- Featured image

Currently, it only works for English Wikipedia. Soon, the app will work for all Wikipedias. Cheers!
